Proud PIAIC Achiever ðŸŒŸ 45 Questions Challenge! ðŸš€
<br>
I enrolled in the PIAIC course, and during the first class, Sir Zia assigned a challenging task with 45 questions. I dedicated the entire night to complete my assignment and submitted it at 5:30 AM. Sir Zia responded with 'Ma sha Allah' upon reviewing my assignment. Although I was initially ranked third on the list of submissions, I proudly became the first girl in my class to complete the assignment within a few hours.
